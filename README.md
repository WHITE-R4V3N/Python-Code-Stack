# Python-Code-Stack
A concept that executes stacked code or functions on the same piece of data. Just a fun python side project to do.

ðŸš€ Mini Framework: Code Stacking
Define a Stack with an input variable.
Add functions (.add) that can depend on input and/or outputs of other functions.
Run the stack â†’ it automatically resolves dependencies and executes in the right order.

The stack runs each stacked piece of code at the same time on the same bit of data (input_value).
